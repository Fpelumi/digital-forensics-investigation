Comprehensive disk and memory forensics analysis using Autopsy and Volatility 3 to recover encrypted data and deleted artifacts
# Digital Forensics Investigation

## 🔍 Project Overview
Comprehensive forensic analysis project combining disk and memory forensics on a Windows 10 system to recover deleted content and decrypt encrypted files using VeraCrypt. Successfully recovered cryptographic keys from volatile memory and reconstructed deleted artifacts.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Autopsy** - Disk forensics and file recovery
- **Volatility 3** - Memory forensics and RAM analysis
- **VeraCrypt** - Encryption analysis
- **FTK Imager** - Evidence acquisition
- **Windows 10** - Target system

## 📋 Methodology

### 1. Evidence Acquisition
- Created forensic disk image using FTK Imager
- Captured memory dump for RAM analysis
- Maintained chain of custody documentation

### 2. Disk Forensics (Autopsy)
- Analyzed file system structures
- Recovered deleted files and folders
- Examined browser history and artifacts
- Timeline analysis of user activity

### 3. Memory Forensics (Volatility 3)
- Identified running processes
- Extracted encryption keys from RAM
- Analyzed network connections
- Recovered cached credentials

### 4. Decryption & Recovery
- Used recovered keys to decrypt VeraCrypt volumes
- Reconstructed deleted file contents
- Documented findings with screenshots

## 🎯 Key Achievements
